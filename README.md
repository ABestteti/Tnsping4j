# Tnsping4j - It is an Java utility to test connection to a Oracle database

This utility works similarly to tnsping; however, tnsping4j uses Oracle's JDBC driver to test connectivity to databse server. Besides, it can be used to certify whether JDBC driver, SQL*Net alias and connect string are compatible to the target database server.
