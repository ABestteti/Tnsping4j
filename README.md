# Tnsping4j - It is a Java utility to test connection to an Oracle database

This utility works similarly to tnsping; however, tnsping4j uses Oracle's JDBC driver to test connectivity to databse server. Besides, it can be used to certify whether JDBC driver, SQL*Net alias and connect string are compatible to the target database server. Then, tnsping4j can be used to validate datasources stored in Java EE application servers, such as Oracle WebLogic, Wildfly, JBoss EAP, Tomcat, among others.
